# Welcome

The Witcher 3 REDkit is a comprehensive modding tool for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt we're currently developing. It is based on the same set of tools that were used by our developers to create the game and should allow for nearly limitless freedom in modding it. REDkit will be available free of charge for all owners of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PC and it's scheduled to release later this year.&#x20;

In order to sign up, simply navigate to the store page of The Witcher 3 REDkit on Steam and request access: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2684660/The\_Witcher\_3\_REDkit/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2684660/The\_Witcher\_3\_REDkit/)&#x20;

**Playtest access will be distributed in batches. After receiving access "The Witcher 3 REDkit Playtest" will appear in your Steam Library.** Remember that the editor will require The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt game files in order to work properly, so make sure you have it installed too! (edited)
